      "When i survey the wondrous cross\nOn which the Prince of glory died,\nMy richest gain I count but loss,\nAnd pour contempt on all my pride.",
      "Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,\nSave in the death of Christ my God!\nAll the vain things that charm me most,\nI sacrifice them to His blood.",
      "See from his head, His hands, His feet,\nsorrow  and love flow mingled down!\nDid e er such love and sorrow meet,\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?",
      "His dying crimson, like a robe,\nSpreads o'er His body on the tree;\nThen I am dead to all the globe,\nAnd all the globe is dead to me.",
      "Were the whole realm of nature mine,\nThat were a present far too small:\nLove so amazing, so divine,\nDemands my soul, my life, my all.",
      "To Christ, Who won for sinners grace\nBy bitter grief and anguish sore,\nBe praise from all the ransomed race\nForever and forevermore."
