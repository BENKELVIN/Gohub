      "Blessed Lamb! On Calvary's mountain\nSlain to take our sins away\nLet the drops of that rich fountain\nOur tremendous ransom pay\nSacred Saviour! Sacred Saviour!",
      "Lowly at thy feet we pray!\nBlessed Lamb! Vouchsafe us pardon\nIn thy love our souls confide\nBy the groans within the garden\nBy the death which thou has died\nLet thy Passion - let thy 
Passion",
      "So shall peace, sweet peace be given,\nPurchase of thy precious pain\nSo shall earth but lead to heaven\nSince for us the Lamb was slain\nDear Redeemer- Dear Redeemer\nThou canst not have 
died in vain"
