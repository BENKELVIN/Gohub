    "verses": [
      "On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of suffering and shame;\nAnd I love that old cross where the dearest and best\nFor a world of lost sinners was slain.",
      "O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,\nHas a wondrous attraction for me;\nFor the dear Lamb of God left His glory above\nTo bear it to dark Calvary.",
      "In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,\nA wondrous beauty I see,\nFor 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,\nTo pardon and sanctify me.",
      "To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;\nIts shame and reproach gladly bear;\nThen He'll call me some day to my home far away,\nWhere His glory forever I'll share."
