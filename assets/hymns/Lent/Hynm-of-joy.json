      "Alleluia! Alleluia! Hearts and voices heav'nward raise\nSing to God a hymn of gladness, Sing to God a hymn of praise.\nChrist, who on the cross a victim, For the world's salvation 
bled,\nJesus Christ, the King of glory, Now is risen from the dead.",
      "Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born,\nGlorious life and life immortal, On that holy Easter morn.\nChrist has triumphed, and we conquer By this mighty 
enterprise,\nWe with Christ to life eternal By his resurrection rise.",
      "Christ is risen, we are risen! Shed upon us heavenly grace,\nRain and dew and gleams of glory From your holy radiant face;\nThat, with hearts in heaven dwelling, We on earth, your servants 
true,\nWill by angel hands be gathered, And be ever, Lord, with you.",
      "Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to God on high;\nAlleluia to the Savior Who has won the victory;\nAlleluia to the Spirit, Fount of love and sanctity;\nAlleluia! Alleluia! To the Triune Majesty."
