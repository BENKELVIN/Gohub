      "Joyful, joyful, we adore you, God of glory, Lord of love;\nHearts unfold like flowers before you, Opening to the sun above.\nMelt the clouds of sin and sadness; Drive the dark of doubt 
away;\nGiver of immortal gladness, Fill us with the light of day!",
      "All your works with joy surround you, Earth and heaven reflect your rays,\nStars and angels sing around you, Center of unbroken praise;\nField and forest, vale and mountain, flowery meadow, 
flashing sea\nChanting bird and flowing fountain, Praising you eternally!",
      "Always giving and forgiving, Ever blessing, ever blest,\nWellspring of the joy of living, Ocean-depth of happy rest!\nLoving Father, Christ our brother, Let your light upon us shine;\nTeach 
us how to love each other, Lift us to the joy divine.",
      "Mortals, join the mighty chorus Which the morning stars began;\nGod's own love is reigning o'er us, Joining people hand in hand.\nEver singing, march we onward, Victors in the midst of 
strife;\nJoyful music lifts us sunward In the triumph song of life."
