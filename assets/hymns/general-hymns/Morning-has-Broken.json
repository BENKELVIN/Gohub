      "Morning has broken Like the first morning,\nBlackbird has spoken Like the first bird.\nPraise for the singing; Praise for the morning;\nPraise for them, springing Fresh from the word",
      "Sweet the rain's new fall Sunlit from heaven,\nLike the first dewfall On the first grass.\nPraise for the sweetness Of the wet garden,\nSprung in completeness Where God has passed.",
      "Mine is the sunlight; Mine is the morning\nBorn  of the one light Eden saw play.\nPraise with elation, Praise every morning,\nGod's re-creation Of the new day."
