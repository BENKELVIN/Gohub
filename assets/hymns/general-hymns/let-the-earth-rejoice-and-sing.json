      "Let the earth rejoice and sing, Alleluia!\nAt the triumph of our King; Alleluia!\nWho ascends from mortal sight, Alleluia!\nReigns now at our Father's right, Alleluia!",
      "Christ who did upon a tree, Alleluia!\nNow shall reign eternally; Alleluia!\nChrist who saved our fallen race, Alleluia\nTakes in heaven his rightful place, Allehuia!",
      "Heaven  and earth shall bend the knee, Alleluia!\nOn this day of victory; Alleluia!\nLife has shattered evil's might, Alleluia!\nRising glorious in our sight, Alleluia!",
      "Jesus, Victor, hear our prayer, Alleluia!\nIn your triumph let us share; Alleluia!\nLift our minds and hearts above, Alleluia!\nStrengthen each one in your love, Alleluia!"
