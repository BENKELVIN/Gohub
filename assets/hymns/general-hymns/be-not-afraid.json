    "verses": [
      "You shall cross the barren desert but you shall not die of thirst.\nYou shall wander far in safety though you do not know the way.\nYou shall speak your words in foreign lands and all will 
understand.\nYou shall see the face of God and live.",
      "If you pass through raging waters in the sea, you shall not drown.\nIf you walk amid the burning flames, you shall not be harmed.\nIf you stand before the power of hell and death is at your 
side,\nknow that I am with you through it all.",
      "Blessed are your poor, for the kingdom shall be theirs.\nBlest are you that weep and mourn, for one day you shall laugh.\nAnd if wicked tongues insult and hate you all because of 
me,\nblessed, blessed are you!"
