      "Now thank we all our God With heart and hands and voices,\nWho wondrous things has done, In whom this world rejoices;\nWho from our mothers arms Has blessed us on our way\nWith countless 
gifts of love, And still is ours today.",
      "O may this bounteous God Through all our life be near us,\nWith ever-joyful hts And blessed peace to cheer us;\nPreserve us in his grace, And guide us when perplexed,\nAnd free us from all 
ills In this world and the next.",
      "All praise and thanks to God The Father now be given,\nThe Son and Spirit blessed Who reign in highest heaven;\nEternal, triune God, Whom earth and heaven adore;\nFor thus it was, is now, And 
shall be evermore."
