      "I am so glad that our Father in heaven\nTells of His love in the Book\nHe had given;\nWonderful things in the Bible I see;\nThis is the dearest, that Jesus loves",
      "Though I forget Him, and wander away,\nStill He doth love me, wherever I stray,\nBack to His dear loving arms do I flee,\nWhen I remember that Jesus loves me.",
      "Oh, if there's only one song I can sing\nWhen in His beauty I see the great King,\nThis shall my song in eternity be\n\"Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!",
      "Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him;\nLove brought Him down my poor soul\nto redeem\nYes, it was love made Him die on the tree;\nOh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!",
      "If one should ask of me, how can I tell?\nGlory to Jesus, I know very well!\nGod's Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,\nConstantly witnessing Jesus loves me.",
      "In this assurance I find sweetest rest,\nTrusting in Jesus, I know I am blest;\naway, Satan dismayed from my soul now doth flee,\nWhen I just tell him that Jesus loves me"
