      "Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,\nAnd in our hearts take up thy rest;\nCome with thy grace and heavenly aid\nTo fill the hearts which thou hast made,\nTo fill the hearts which thou hast 
made.",
      "O Comforter, to thee we cry,\nThou heavenly gift of God most high,\nThou font of life and fire of love,\nAnd sweet anointing from above,\nAnd sweet anointing from above.",
      "Praise be to thee, Father and Son,\nAnd Holy Spirit, with them one;\nAnd may the Son on us bestow\nThe gifts that from the Spirit flow,\nThe gifts that from the Spirit flow."
