      "At that first eucharist before you died,\nO Lord, you prayed that all be one in you\nAt this our eucharist again preside,\nAnd in our hearts your law of love renew.\nO may we all one bread, 
one body be\nThrough this blest sacrament of unity",
      "For all your Church, O Lord, we intercede;\nO make our lack of charity to cease;\nDraw us the nearer each to each, we plead,\nBy drawing all to you, O Prince of Peace.\nO may we all one 
bread, one body be,\nThrough this blest sacrament of unity",
      "We pray for those who wander from the fold;\nO bring them back, good shepherd of the sheep,\nBack to the faith which saints believed of old,\nBack to the Church which still that faith does 
keep.\nO may we all one bread, one body be,\nThrough this blest. sacrament of unity.",
      "So, Lord, at length when sacraments shall cease,\nMay we be one with all your Church above,\nOne with your saints in one unending peace,\nOne with your saints in one unbounded love.\nO may we 
all one bread, one body be,\nThrough this blest sacrament of unity."
