      "I FEEL like singing all the time,\nMy tears are wiped away;\nFor Jesus is a Friend of mine,\nI'll  serve Him every day.",
      "When on the cross my Lord I saw,\nNailed there by sins of mine,\nFast fell the burning tears; but now\nI am singing all the time.",
      "When fierce, temptations try my heart,\nI'll sing, \"Jesus is mine:\nAnd so, though tears at times may start\nI'm singing all the time,",
      "The wondrous story of the Lamb\nell with that voice of thine,\nill others, with the glad new song,\no singing all the time."
