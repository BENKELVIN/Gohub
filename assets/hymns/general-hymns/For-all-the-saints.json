      "For all the saints, who from their labors rest,\nAll who by faith before the world confessed,\nYour name, O Jesus, be forever blest. Alleluia! Alleluia!",
      "You were their rock, their fortress, and their might;\nYou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;\nYou, in the darkness drear, their one true light. Alleluia!\nAlleluia!",
      "O may your soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,\nFight as the saints who nobly fought of old,\nAnd win, with them, the victor's crown of gold. Alleluia!\nAlleluia!",
      "O blest communion, family divine!\nWe feebly struggle, they in glory shine;\nYet all are one within your great design. Alleluia! Alleluia!",
      "And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,\nSteals on the ear the distant triumph song\nAnd hearts are brave again, and arms are strong. Alleluia!\nAlleluia!",
      "The golden evening brightens in the west;\nSoon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest;\nSweet is the calm of paradise the blest. Alleluia! Alleluia!",
      "But then there breaks a yet more glorious day\nThe saints triumphant rise in bright array;\nThe King of glory passes on his way. Alleluia! Alleluial",
      "From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,\nThrough gates of pearl streams in the countless host,\nSinging to Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Alleluia! Alleluia"
