      "Holy God, we praise thy name; Lord of all, we bow before thee!\nAll on earth thy rule acclaim, All in heaven above adore thee;\nInfinite thy vast domain, Everlasting is thy reign.\nInfinite 
thy vast domain, Everlasting is thy reign.",
      "Hark! The loud celestial hymn Angel choirs above are raising,\nCherubinm and seraphim, In unceasing chorus praising;\nFill the heaven with sweet accord: \"Holy, holy, holy Lord.\nFill the 
heavens with sweet accord: \"Holy, holy, holy Lord.",
      "Lo! The apostolic train Join, the sacred name to hallow;\nProphets swell the loud refrain, And the white-robed martyrs follow;\nAnd from morn to set of sun, Through the Church the song goes 
on.\nAnd from morn to set of sun, Through the Church the song goes on.",
      "Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit, Three we name thee;\nWhile in essence only One, Undivided God we 'claim thee;\nAnd adoring bend the knee, While we own the mystery.\nAnd adoring bend the 
knee, While we own the mystery."
