      "At the Lamb's high feast we sing Praise to our victorious King\nWho has washed us in the tide Flowing from his wounded side;\nPraise we Christ whose love divine Gives his sacred blood for 
wine,\nGives his body for the feast, Christ the victim, Christ the priest.",
      "Where the paschal blood is poured, Death's dark angel sheathes the sword;\nIsreal's hosts triumphant go Through the wave that drowns the foe.\nPraise we Christ whose blood was shed, Paschal 
victim, paschal bread;\nWith sincerity and love Eat we manna from above.",
      "Mighty Victim from the sky, Hell's fierce power beneath you lie;\nYou have conquered in the fight, You have brought us life and light;\nNow no more can death appall, Now no more the grave 
enthral1;\nYou have opened Paradise, And in you the saints shall rise.",
      "Easter triumph, Easter joy, Have the power of sin destroyed.\nFrom the power of sin set free, Newborn souls in Christ are we.\nHymns of glory, songs of praise, Father, unto you we 
raise;\nPraise to you, our risen Lord, And the Spirit we accord."
