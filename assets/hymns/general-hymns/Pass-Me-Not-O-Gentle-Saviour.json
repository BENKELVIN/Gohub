      "Pass me not O gentle Saviour\nHear my humble cry;\nWhile on others Thou art calling,\nDo not pass me by.",
      "Let me at a throne of mercy\nFind a sweet relief;\nkneeling there in deep contrition,\nHelp my unbelief.",
      "Trusting only in Thy merit,\nWould I seek Thy face;\nHeal my wounded, broken spirit,\nSave me by Thy grace",
      "Thou the spring of all my comfort,\nMore than life to me;\nWhom have I on earth beside Thee?\nWhom in heaven but Thee?"
