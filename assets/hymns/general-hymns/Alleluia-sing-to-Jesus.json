      "Alleluia! Sing to Jesus, His the scepter, his the throne;\nAlleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone;\nHark! the songs of peaceful Zion Thunder like a mighty flood,\nJesus out of every 
nation Has redeemed us by his blood.",
      "Alleluia! Not as orphans Are we left in sorrow now;\nAlleluia! He is near us, Faith believes, nor questions how;\nThough the cloud from sight received him\nWhen the forty days were o'er, 
Shall our hearts forget his promise,\n\"I am with you evermore\"?",
      "Alleluia! Bread of angels, You on earth our food, our stay;\nAlleluia! Here the sinful Flee to you from day to day;\nIntercessor, friend of sinners, Earth's Redeemer, plead for me,\nHere the 
songs of all the sinless Sweep across the crystal sea.",
      "Alleluia! King eternal, You the Lord of lords we own;\nAlleluia! Son of Mary, Son of God from heaven's throne;\nOur salvation you accomplished, Robed in flesh, our great High Priest\nHere on 
earth both priest and victim In the eucharistic feast."
