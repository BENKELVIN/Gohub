      "Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,\nThat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found,\nWas blind, but now I see.",
      "It was grace that taught my heart to fear,\nAnd grace my fears relieved;\nHow precious did that grace appear\nThe hour I first believed!",
      "Through many dangers, toils, and snares\nI have already come;\nTis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home"
