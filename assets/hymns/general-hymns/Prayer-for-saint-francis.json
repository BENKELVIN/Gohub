      "Make me a channel of your peace.\nWhere there is hatred, let me bring your love.\nWhere there is injury your pardon, Lord.\nAnd where there's doubt, true faith in you.",
      "Make me a channel of your peace.\nWhere there's despair in life, let me bring hope..\nWhere there is darkness, only light..\nAnd where there's sadness, ever joy.",
      "O master, grant that I may never seek\nso much to be consoled, as to console,\nTo be understood, as to understand,\nTo be loved, as to love with all my soul.",
      "Make me a channel of your peace.\nIt is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nIn giving of ourselves that we receive,\nand in dying that we're born to eternal life."
