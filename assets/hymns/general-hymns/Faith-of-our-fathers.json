    "verses": [
      "Faith of our fathers, living still, In spite of dungeon, fire, and Sword:\nO how our hearts beat high with joy, Whene'er we hear that glorious word:",
      "Our fathers, chained in prisons dark, Were still in heart and conscience free;\nAnd truly blest would be our fate, If we, like them,, should die for thee.",
      "Our mothers, too, oppressed and wronged, Still lived their faith with dignity;\nTheir brave example gives us strength To work for justice ceaselessly.",
      "Faith of our fathers, faith and prayer Shall win all nations unto thee;\nAnd through the truth that comes from God, We all shall then indeed be free.",
      "Faith of our fathers, we will love Both friend and foe in all our strife,\nAnd preach thee, too, as love knows how, By kindly deeds and virtuous life."
