      "Crown him with many crowns, The Lamb upon the throne;\nHark! how the heavenly anthem drowns All music but its own.\nAwake, my soul, and sing To Christ, who set us free,\nAnd hail him as your 
heavenly King Through all eternity.",
      "Crown him the Lord of life, Who triumphed o'er the grave,\nAnd rose victorious in the strife For those he came to save.\nHis glories now we sing, Who died and rose on high,\nWho died, eternal 
life to bring, And lives that death may die.",
      "Crown him the Lord of love, Behold his hands and side,\nRich wounds yet visible above In beauty glorified.\nNo angel in the sky Can fully bear that sight,\nBut downward bends his burning eye 
At mysteries so bright.",
      "Crown him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways\nFrom pole to pole, that wars may cease, Absorbed in prayer and praise.\nHis reign shall know no end, And round his pierced feet\nFair 
flowers of Paradise extend Their fragrance ever sweet.",
      "Crown him the Lord of years, The risen Lord sublime,\nCreator of the rolling spheres, The Master of all time.\nAll hail, Redeemer, hail! For you have died for me;\nYour praise and glory shall 
not fail Throughout eternity."
