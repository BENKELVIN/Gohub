      "God's blessing sends us forth, Strengthened for our task on earth,\nRefreshed in soul and renewed in mind.\nMay God with us remain, Through us the Spirit reign,\nThat Christ be known to 
humankind.",
      "God's news in spoken word Joyfully our hearts have heard;\nO may the seed of God's love now grow.\nMay we in fruitful deeds Gladly serve others' needs,\nThat faith in action we may show.",
      "We by one living bread As one body have been fed;\nSo we are one as we share this food.\nHow gracious to behold All people of one fold\nWho ever seek each other's good.",
      "Grant in this age of space Triumph of your truth and grace;\nLord, you alone are unchanging truth.\nBring us unto your side; Preserve and ever guide\nYour ancient Church in ageless youth."
