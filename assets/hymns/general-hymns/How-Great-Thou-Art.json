    "verses": [
      "O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the worlds thy hand hath made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy power throughout the universe displayed",
      "When through the woods and forest glades I wander,\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle 
breeze;",
      "And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,\nSent him to die, I scarce can take it in,\nThat on the cross my burden gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin",
      "When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration\nAnd there proclaim, \"My God, how great thou art!\""
