      "Humbly we adore you, Christ, Redeemer, King;\nYou are Lord of heaven, you to whom we sing.\nGod, the Mighty, you have come, bearing gifts of grace;\nSon of Adam still you are, Savior to our 
race.",
      "Jesus, Lord, we thank you for this wondrous bread;\nIn our land now dwelling, by you we are fed.\nWe who share this mystery in you are made one;\nevery  act we offer you in your name is 
done.",
      "You who died to save us live now as our light;\nThough our eyes are blinded, yet our faith gives sight.\nSavior, now be merciful, Lamb for sinners slain,\nWe in grief confess our guilt; 
cleanse our souls of stain.",
      "Christ, our God and brother, hear our humble plea;\nBy this holy banquet grant us unity\nMake us one in loving you, one in mind and heart,\nTill in heaven we are yours, never more to part.",
      "Hail, O Word Incarnate, born from Mary's womb\nHail, O Strength immortal, risen from the tomb.\nShare with us your victory, Savior ever blest:\nLive more fully in our hearts; be our constant 
guest.",
      "Faith alone reveals here bread of Paradise;\nFaith alone may witness Jesus' sacrifice\nTherefore, Lord, as once of old Thomas gained his sight,\nNow increase our feeble faith; shed your 
healing light.",
      "Christ, at his last supper, breaking bread, decreed:\n\"This, my body, take and eat;\" heavenly food indeed!\nThen he blessed the cup of wine; \"take and drink,\" he said:\n\"From this 
chalice of my blood, soon for sinners shed.\"",
      "Now with glad thanksgiving, praise Christ glorified\nHe in us is present; we in him abide.\nMembers of his body, we in him are one;\nHail this sacred anion, heaven on earth begun!"
