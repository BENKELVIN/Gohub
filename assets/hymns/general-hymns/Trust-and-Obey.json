    "verses": [
      "When we walk with the Lord in the light of his word\nWhat a glory he sheds on our way!\nWhile we do his goodwill,\nhe abides with us still,\nAnd with all who will trust and obey",
      "Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies.\nBut his smile quickly drives it away;\nNot a doubt or a fear, not a sigh nor a tear\nCan abide while we trust and obey",
      "Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share\nBut our toil he doth richly repay\nNor a grief nor a loss, not a crown or a Cross,\nBut is blest if we trust and obey",
      "But we never can prove the delight his love\nUntil all on the alter we lay\nFor the favour he shows and the joy he bestows\nAre for them, who will trust and obey"
