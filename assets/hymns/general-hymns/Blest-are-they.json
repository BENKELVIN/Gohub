      "Blest are they, the poor in spirit, theirs is the kingdom of God\nBlest are they, full of sorrow, they shall be consoled.",
      "Blest are they, the lowly ones, they shall inherit the earth.\nBlest are they who hunger and thirst, they shall have their fill.",
      "Blest are they who show mercy, mercy shall be theirs.\nBlest are they, the pure of heart, they shall see God!",
      "Blest are they who seek peace; they are the children of God.\nBlest are they who suffer in faith, the glory of God is theirs.",
      "Blest are you who suffer hate, all because of me.\nRejoice and be glad, yours is the kingdom; shine for all to see."
