      "The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want\nHe makes me down to lie\nIn pastures green; he leadeth me\nThe quiet waters by",
      "My soul he doth restore again\nAnd me to walk doth make\nWithin the paths of righteousness\nEven for his own name sake",
      "Yea, though I walk through death's Dark vale\nYet willI fear no ill;\nFor thou art with me, and thy rod\nAnd staff me comfort still",
      "My table thou hast furnished \nin presence of my foes\nMy head thou does with oil anoint\nAnd my cup overflows",
      "Goodness and mercy all my life\nshall surely follow me;\nAnd in God's house for evermore\nMy dwelling place shall be"
