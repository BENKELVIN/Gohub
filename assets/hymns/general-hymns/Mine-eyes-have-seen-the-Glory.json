      "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;\nHe is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\nHe has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift 
sword;\nHis truth is marching on.\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!\nGlory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on",
      "I have seen him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps;\nThey have built him an altar in the evening dews and damps.\nI can read the righteous sentence by the dim and flaring 
lamps\nHis day is marching on.",
      "He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;\nHe is sifting out the hearts of all before his judgment seat.\nO be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant, my feet!\nOur 
God is marching on.",
      "In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,\nWith a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.\nAs he died to make us holy, let us live to make all free!\nWhile God is 
marching on.",
      "He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave;\nHe is wisdom to the mighty, he is honor to the brave.\nSo the world shall be his footstool, and the soul of wrong his slave.\nOur God 
is marching on."
