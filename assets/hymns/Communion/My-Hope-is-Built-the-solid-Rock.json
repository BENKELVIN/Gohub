      "My hope is built on nothing less\nThan Jesus' blood and righteousness.\nI dare not trust the sweetest frame,\nBut wholly trust in Jesus Name.",
      "On Christ the solid Rock I stand,\nAll other ground is sinking sand;\nAll other ground is sinking sand.",
      "When darkness seems to hide His face,\nI rest on His unchanging grace.\nIn every high and stormy gale,\nMy anchor holds within the veil.",
      "His oath, His covenant, His blood,\nSupport me in the whelming flood.\nWhen all around my soul gives way,\nHe then is all my Hope and Stay.",
      "When He shall come with trumpet sound,\nOh may I then in Him be found.\nDressed in His righteousness alone,\nFaultless to stand before the throne."
