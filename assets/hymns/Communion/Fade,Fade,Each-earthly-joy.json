      "Fade, fade each earthly joy, Jesus is mine\nBreak every tender tie, Jesus is mine\nDark is the wilderness, earth has no resting place\nJesus alone can bless, Jesus is mine",
      "Tempt not my soul away, Jesus is mine\nHere would I ever stay, Jesus is mine\nPerishing things of clay born but for one brief day\nPass from my heart away, Jesus is mine",
      "Farewell, ye dreams of night,\nJesus is mine\nLost in the dawning light, Jesus is mine\nAll that my soul has tried\nleft but a dismal void\nJesus has satisfied, Jesus is mine",
      "Farewell, mortality, Jesus is mine\nWelcome, eternity, Jesus is mine\nWelcome o loved and blest\nWelcome sweet scenes of rest\nWelcome, my Saviour rest, Jesus is mine"
