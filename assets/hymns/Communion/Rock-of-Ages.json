      "Rock of ages cleft for me\nLet me hide myself in thee\nLet the water and the blood\nFrom thy riven side which flowed\nBe of sin the double cure\nSave me from its guilt and power",
      "Not the labour of my hands\nCan fulfill thy laws demands\nCould my zeal no respite know\nCould my tears forever flow\nAll for sin could not atone\nThou must save and thou alone",
      "Nothing in my hand I bring\nSimply to thy cross I cling\nNaked come to thee for dress\nHelpless look to thee for grace\nFoul, I to the fountain fly\nWash me Saviour or I die",
      "While I draw this fleeting breath\nWhen my eyelids close in death\nWhen I soar to worlds unknown\nSee thee on thy judgment throne\nRock of ages cleft for me\nLet me hide myself in thee"
