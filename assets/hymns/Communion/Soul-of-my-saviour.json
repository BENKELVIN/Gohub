      "Soul of my Saviour sanctity my breast\nBody of Christ be thou my saving guest\nBod of my Saviour bathe me in thy side\nWash me with water flowing from thy side",
      "Strength and protection may thy passion be\nO blessed Jesus hear and answer me\nDeep in thy wounds Lord hide and shelter me\nSo shall I never, never part from thee",
      "Guide and defend me from the foe malign\nIn death's dread moment make me only thine\nCall me and bid me come to thee on high\nWhere I may praise thee, with the saints on aye"
