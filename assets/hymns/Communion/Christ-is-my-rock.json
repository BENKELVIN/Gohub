    "chorus": "Christ is my Rock, my Refuge, my Stronghold\nFirm as the tree's root that clutches the land\nHe who has faith builds without wory\nNot like the man who build upon sand\nI set my house 
on a solid foundation\nChrist is my Rock the root of my soul's recreation",
    "verses": [
      "I know a man who loved to live free\nHe pitched his tent bythe side of the sea\nIt stood near the surf nd was washed by the spray\nTill one day a wave iame and washed it away",
      "I know a man who loved to live high\nHe build his castle near up to the sky\nthrough summer and spring it stood pretty well\nWhen winter winds whistled it toppled and fell.",
      "I know a man a cool one to know,\nHe built his house out of ice and snow\nIn chill isolation his night work was done\nBut melted away with warm morning sun",
      "I know a man who built out of straw\nThe flimsiest fellow that I ever saw\nOne day a spark set it to flame\nAnd nothing was left to remember his name"
