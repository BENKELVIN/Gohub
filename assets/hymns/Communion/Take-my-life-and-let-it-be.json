      "Take my life, and let it be consecrated, Lord, to Thee.\nTake my moments and my days; let them flow in ceaseless praise.\nTake my hands, and let them move at the impulse of Thy love.\nTake my 
feet, and let them be swift and beautiful for Thee.",
      "Take my voice, and let me sing always, only, for my King\nTake my lips, and let them be filled with messages from Thee.\nTake my silver and my gold; not a mite would I withhold.\nTake my 
intellect, and use every power as Throu shalt choose.",
      "Take my will, and make it Thine; it shall be no longer mine\nTake my heart, it is Thine own; it shall be Thy royal throne.\nTake my love, my Lord, I pour at Thy feet its treasure store.\nTake 
myself, and I will be ever, only, all for Thee."
