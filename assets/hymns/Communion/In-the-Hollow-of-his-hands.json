      "With my Saviour ever near to guide\nI am safe whatever may betide me\nFrom the storm and tempest he will guide me\nIn the hollow of His hands",
      "His arms of love he doth enfold me\nWords of peace His voice divine hath told me\nI am safe for God Himself doth hold me\nIn the hollow of His hands",
      "He will guard my soul and leave me never\nFrom His love no power on earth shall severs\nAnd I know he'll keep me now and ever\nIn the hollow of His hands"
