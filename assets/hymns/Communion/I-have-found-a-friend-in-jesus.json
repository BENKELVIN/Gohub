      "I have found a friend in Jesus,\nHe's everything to me\nHe's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul\nThe lily of the valley in Him alone I see\nAll I need to cleanse and make me fully whole",
      "And all my grief He has taken\nAnd all my sorrows borne\nIn temptation He's my strength and mighty pow\nI have all for Him forsaken, I've all my idols torn\nFrom my heart and now he keeps me 
by His po'",
      "Though all the world forsake me,\nAnd Satan tempted me\nSure through Jesus shall safely reach the goal\nHe's the lily of the valley\nThe bright and moming star\nHe's the fairest of ten 
thousand to my soul"
