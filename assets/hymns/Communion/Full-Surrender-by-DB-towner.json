      "Saviour tis a full surrender\nAll leave to follow thee\nThou my leader and defender\nFrom this hour shalt ever be",
      "As I come in deep contrition\nAt this consecrated hour\nHear 0 Christ my heart's petition\nLet me feel the Spirit's power.",
      "No withholding full confession,\nPleasures riches, all must flee\nHoly Spirit take possession,\nI no more but Christ in me.",
      "Be this theme my song and story\nNow and until live is o'er\nThis my rapture this my glory\nTill I reach the shinning shore",
      "Oh the joy of full salvation!\nOh the peace of love divine!\nOh the bliss of consecration!\nam His and He is mine."
