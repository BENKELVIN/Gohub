      "Ride on ride on in majesty\nHark all the tribes Hosanna cry\nO Saviour meek pursue thy road\nWith palms and scattered garments strewed",
      "Ride on ride on in majesty\nThe angel armies of the sky ad\nLook down with sad and wondering eyes\nTo see the appearing sacrifice",
      "Ride on ride on in majesty\nThe last and fiercest strife is night\nThe father on His sapphire throne\nAwaits His own anonted Son",
      "Ride on ride on in majesty\nIn lowly pomp ride on to die\nBow thy meek head to mortal pain\nThen take 0 God thy power and reign"
