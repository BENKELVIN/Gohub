      "As when the shepherd calls his sheep,\nThey know and heed his voice\nSo when you call your family Lord\nWe follow and rejoice\nWith joyful lips we sing to you,",
      "Our praise and gratitude\nThat you should count us worthy Lord,\nTo share this heavenly food",
      "Is not the cup we bless and share,\nThe blood of Christ outpoured?\nDo not one cup one loaf declare\nOur oneness in the Lord?",
      "The mystery of your presence Lord,\nNo mortal tongue can tell\nWhom all the world cannot contain\nComes in our hearts to dwell",
      "You give yourself to us o Lord\nThen selfless let us be\nTo serve each other in your name\nIn truth and charity"
