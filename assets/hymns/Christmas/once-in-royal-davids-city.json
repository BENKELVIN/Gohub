        "√Ånd through all his wondrous childhood he will honour and obey, Love and watch the lowly mother, in whose gentle arms he lay. Christian children all must be mild, obedient, good as he.",
        "for he is our childhood's patron: day by day like us he grew; He was little, weak and helpless; Tears and smile like us he know; And He feeleth for our sadness, And He shareth in our gladness.",
        "And our eyes at last shall see Him through His own redeeming love; for that child, so dear and gentle, is our lord in heaven above; And He leads His children on to the place where He is gonne.",
        "Not in that poor, lowly stable, with the oxen standing by, we shall see Him - but in heaven, sit at God's right hand and high, when like stars his children crowned, and in white shall wait around"
