    "verses": [
      "We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on land,\nBut it is fed and watered by God's almighty hand;\nHe sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell grain,\nThe breezes and the 
sunshine, and soft refreshing",
      "He only is the Maker of all things near and far;\nHe paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star\nThe winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds fed;\nMuch more to us, His children, 
He gives our daily bread",
      "We thank Thee, then, o Father, for all things bright and good,\nThe seed time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food;\nNo gifts have we to offer, for all Thy love imparts\nBut that 
which Thou desirest, our humble, thankful hearts."
