      "Help us Thy Name to sing, help us to praise!\nFather all glorious, over all victorious,\nCome and reign over us, Ancient of Days!",
      "Come, Thou incarnate Word,\nGird on Thy mighty sword, our prayer attend!\nCome, and Thy people bless, and give Thy Word success,\nSpirit of holiness, on us descend!",
      "Come, holy Comforter,\nThy sacred witness bear in this glad hour.\nThou Who almighty art, now rule in every heart,\nAnd ne'er from us depart, Spirit of power!",
      "To Thee, great One in Three,\nEtermal praises be, hence, evermore.\nThy sovereign majesty may we in glory see,\nAnd to eternity love and adore!"
