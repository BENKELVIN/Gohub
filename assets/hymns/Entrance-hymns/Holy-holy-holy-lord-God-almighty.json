      "Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty\nEarly in the morning our songs shall rise to thee\nHoly, holy, holy merciful and mighty\nGod in three persons Blessed Trinity",

      "Holy, holy, holy though the darkness hide thee\nThough the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see\nOnly thou art holy, there is none beside thee\nPerfect in power, in love and purity",
      "Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty\nAll thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea\nHoly, holy, holy merciful and mighty\nGod in three persons Blessed Trinity."
