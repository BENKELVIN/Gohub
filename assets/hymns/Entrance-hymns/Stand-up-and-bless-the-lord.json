      "Stand up and bless the Lord\nYou people of His choice\nStand up and bless the Lord\nYour God with heart and soul and mind",
      "Though high above all praise\nAbove all blessing high\nWho would not fear His holy name\nAnd laud and magnify",
      "O for the living flame\nFrom His own altar brought\nTo touch our lips, our mind\nIn spirit and wing to heaven our thought",
      "God is our strength and song,\nAnd His salvation ours,\nThen be His love in Christ proclaimed\nWith all our ransomed powers."
