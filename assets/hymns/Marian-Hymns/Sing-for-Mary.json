      "Sing of Mary, pure and lowly, Virgin Mother\nUndefiled. Sing of God's own most holy\nWho became her little child. Fairest Child of\nfairest Mother, God the Lord who came to earth,\nword made 
flesh, our very brother,\nTakes our nature by his birth.",
      "Sing of Jesus, son of Mary, In the home at\nNazareth. Toil and labor cannot weary\nLove enduring unto death. Constant was the\nlove the gave her, Through he went forth from her side,\nForth 
to preach and heal and suffer,\nTill on Calvary he died.",
      "Joyful Mother, full of gladness, In your arms your\nLord was borne. Mournful mother, full of sadness,\nAll your heart with pain was torn. Glorious Mother\nnow rewarded with a crown at Jesus' 
hand,\nAge to age your name recorded\nShall be blest in every land.",
      "Glory be to God the Father; Glory be to\nGod the son; Glory be to God the Spirit;\nGlory to the three in one. From the heart of\nblessed Mary, from all saints the song ascends,\nAnd the 
church the strain reechoes\nUnto earths remotest ends."
