      "My soul proclaims the Lord my God. My spirit sings God's praise,\nWho looks on me, and lifts me up, That gladness fills my days.",
      "All nations now will share my joy; For gifts God has out poured.\nThis lowly one has been made great. I magnify the Lord.",
      "For those who fear the Holy One, God's mercy will not, die.\nWhose strong right arm puts down the proud, And lifts the lowly high.",
      "God fills the hungry with good things, And sends the rich away;\nThe promise made to Abraham Is filled to endless day.",
      "Then let all nations praise our God, The Father and the Son,\nThe Spirit blest, who lives in us, While endless ages run."
