      "Standing on the promises I now can see\nPerfect, present, cleasing in the blood for me\nStanding in the liberty where Christ makes free\nStanding on the promises of God.",
      "Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord\nBound to him etermally by love's strong word\nOvercoming daily with spirit's sword\nStanding on the promises of God.",
      "Standing on the promises cannot fail\nListening every moment to the spirit's call,\nResting in my savior as my all in all\nStanding on the promises of God."
