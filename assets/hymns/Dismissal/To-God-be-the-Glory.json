      "To God be the glory great things He hath done\nSo loved He the world that He gave us His Son\nWho yielded His life on atonement for sin\nAnd open the life gate that all may go in",
      "Praise the Lord, praise the Lord let the people rejoice\nOh come to the Father through Jesus the Son\nAnd give Him the glory great thing He hath done",
      "Oh perfect redemption, the purchase of blood\nTo every believer the promise of God\nThe vilest offender who truly believes,\nThat moment from Jesus a pardon receives.",
      "Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,\nAnd great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;\nBut purer and higher and greater will be\nOur wonder, our transport when Jesus we 
see."
