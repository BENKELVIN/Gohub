      "Nearer, Imy God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!\nE'en though it be a cross that raiseth me, .\nStill all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.",
      "Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,\nDarkness be over me, my rest a stone.\nYet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God to Thee.",
      "There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;\nAll that Thou sendest me, in mercy given,\nAngels to beckon me nearer, my God to Thee nearer to Thee",
      "Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,\nOut of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;\nSo by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee.",
      "Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky,\nSun, moon, and stars forgot, upward Il fy,\nDull all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.",
      "There in my Father’s home, safe and at rest,\nThere in my Savior’s love, perfectly blest;\nAge after age to be nearer my God to Thee"
