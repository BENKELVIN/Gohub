      "I am just a weary pilgrim,\nplodding through this world of sin,\nGetting ready for that meeting\nWhen the saints go marching in.",
      "Up there I'll see the Saviour\nWho redeemed my soul from sin;\nWith extended hands He'll greet me\nwhen the Saints go marching in.",
      "We are treading on the pathway\nOf the saints gone on before;\nBut we'Il meet gin together\nOver on the golden shore."
