      "Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep!\nFrom which none ever wake to weep\nA calm and undisturbed repose \nunbroken by the last of foes.",
      "Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet\nTo be for such a slumber meet!\nWith holy confidence to sing\nThat death hath lost its venomed sting!",
      "Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest!\nWhose waking is supremely blest,\nNo fear, no woe, shall dim the hour\nThat manifest the Saviour's power.",
      "Asleep in Jesus! Oh for me\nMay such a blissful refuge be!\nSecurely shall my ashes lie\nWaiting the summons from on high",
      "Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee\nThy kindred and their graves may be\nBut thine is still a blessed sleep\nFrom which none ever wake to sleep"
