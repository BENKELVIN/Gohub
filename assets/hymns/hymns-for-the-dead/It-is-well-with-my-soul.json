    "verses": [
      "When peace like a river attendant my way,\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll\nwhatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.",
      "Though Satan should buffet, though trial should come\nLet this bless assurance control,\nThat Christ has regarded my helpless estate,\nAnd hath shed His own blood for my soul.",
      "My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought!\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!",
      "for me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:\nIf Jordan above me shall roll,\nNo pang shall be mine, for in death as in life\nThou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.",
      "But Lord, tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,\nThe sky, not the grave, is our goal;\nOh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!\nBlessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!"
