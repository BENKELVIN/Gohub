      "Fade, fade, each earthly joy, Jesus is mine!\nBreak every tender tie; Jesus is mine!\nLark is the wilderness\nearth has no resting place,\nJesus alone can bless, Jesus is mine!",
      "Tempt not my soul away; Jesus is mine!\nHere would I ever stay; Jesus is mine!\nPerishing things of clay,\nBorn but for one brief day,\nPass from my heart away! Jesus is mine!",
      "Farewell, ye dreams of night; Jesus is mine!\nst in this dawning light; Jesus is mine!\nl that my soul has tried,\nft but a dismal void\nsus has satisfied; Jesus is mine!",
      "Farewell, mortality; Jesus is mine!\ncome, eternity, Jesus is mine!\ncome, O loved and blest;\ncome, sweet scenes of rest;\ncome, my Saviour bless; Jesus is mine!"
