      "Jerusalem, my happy home,\nWhen shall I come to thee?\nWhen shall my sorrows have an end?\nThy joys when shall I see?",
      "O happy harbour of the saints!\nO sweet and pleasant soil!\nIn thee no sorrow may be found,\nNo grief no care, no toil.",
      "In thee no sickness may be seen,\nNo hurt, no ache, no sore:\nIn thee there is no dread of death,\nBut life for evermore.",
      "No dampish mist is seen in thee,\nNo cold nor darksome night;\nThere every soul shines as the sun;\nThere God himself gives light.",
      "There lust and lucre cannot dwell;\nThere envy bears no sway;\nThere is no hunger, heat, nor cold.\nBut pleasure every way.",
      "Jerusalem, Jerusalem,\nGod grant I once may see\nThy endless joys, and of the same\nPartaker aye may be!",
      "Thy walls are made of precious stones,\nThy bulwarks diamonds square;\nThy gates are of right orient pearl;\nExceeding rich and rare;",
      "Thy turrets and thy pinnacles\nWith carbuncles do shine;\nThy very streets are paved with gold,\nSurpassing clear and fine;",
      "Thy houses are of ivory,\nThy windows crystal clear;\nThy titles are made of beaten gold\nO God that I were there.",
      "Within thy gates nothing doth come\nThat is not passing clean,\nNo spider's web, no dirt, no dust,\nNo filth may there be seen.",
      "Ah, my sweet home, Jerusalem,\nWould God I were in thee!\nWould God my woes were at an end.\nThy joys that I might see!"
