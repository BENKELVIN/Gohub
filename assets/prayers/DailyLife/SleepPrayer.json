      "Prayer": "Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit. Lord Jesus, receive my soul. In the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ crucified, I lay down to sleep. Bless me, O Lord, and defend me, preserve me from sudden and unprovided death and from all dangers, and bring me unto life everlasting with you. Amen."
